# Airline-Satisfaction-Prediction-Using-ML


## About

The airline industry relies heavily on customer satisfaction, which directly affects business success and profitability. Airlines face challenges in predicting customer satisfaction due to diverse passenger demographics and varying service quality. The growth of data from booking systems, social media, and surveys offers opportunities to better understand passenger preferences. Machine learning enables the analysis of large datasets to identify patterns and insights for informed decision-making. Predictive analytics through machine learning can forecast customer satisfaction based on historical data and real-time inputs. Machine learning can optimize flight schedules, improve customer service, and personalize the travel experience. Successful implementations of machine learning in sectors like hospitality and retail demonstrate its potential in the airline industry. The project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict airline customer satisfaction, enhancing service delivery and passenger experiences.

## Requirements

### 1. Software Requirements:

Operating System: The system must run on Windows 10 or later. This ensures compatibility with the required software tools and libraries used for developing the sign language detection system.

Tool: Anaconda is recommended as the primary tool for managing the development environment. It simplifies package management and deployment of Python projects. The Anaconda distribution includes Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive interface for writing and executing Python code, ideal for prototyping and visualizing results in real time.

### 2. Hardware Requirements:

Processor: An Intel i3 processor or later is necessary to ensure that the system can handle the computational demands of deep learning tasks and data processing effectively. This requirement ensures adequate processing power for executing the algorithms efficiently.

Hard Disk: A minimum of 10 GB of free hard disk space is required. This space will accommodate the operating system, Anaconda, libraries (like TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.), and datasets needed for training the sign language detection model.

RAM: At least 4 GB of RAM is necessary for smooth operation of the development environment and to run various processes without significant slowdowns. More RAM may be beneficial for handling larger datasets and models, improving performance during training and inference stages.

## Results and Impact

Harnessing machine learning for next-level airline satisfaction prediction holds great promise for transforming the way airlines understand and enhance customer experiences. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics, airlines can gain deeper insights into customer sentiments, preferences, and behaviors.
The application of machine learning in this context can lead to significantly improved predictive accuracy, enabling airlines to anticipate customer needs and proactively address issues. 
This not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters a more personalized approach to customer engagement, ultimately increasing loyalty and satisfaction.
